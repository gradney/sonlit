Why?
I keep notes here because I can't remember everything. That's all. Eventually I'll move this into github's wiki section.

I'm going through this book to refresh my memory and actually build something productive. Wish me luck!

DEFINITIONS
---
Components - teaching the browser new tags like <video> or <form> that have custom functionality attached to them. (From AngularJS, this use to be called 'directives'.) Includes two parts: 1) Decorator, 2) Definition.

TERMS
---
__destructuring__ - a feature provided by ES6 and TypeScript...
__decorating__ - adding metadata to our code to make it a decorated component.
__multiline strings__ - a method using backticks (`...`) to add multi-line strings within a template section of @Component instead of using the referenced template (i.e. html).
__style-encapsulation__ - styles specified for a particular component only apply to that component; note that multiple stylesheets can be loaded for a single componenet in its styleUrls section.
__template tages__ - aka 'mustache tags, are the double curly braces used around a property name in a template for rendering its value.
__@NgModule__ has 4 keys: 1) declarations, 2) imports, 3) providers, 4) bootstrap. Module is something like a 'package'.
__declarations__ must declare components in a NgModule before can be used in templates. (Basically, no different from declaring a variable or object.)
__imports__ describes which _dependencies_ this module has.
__providers__ used for _dependency injection_.
__bootstrap__ when module is used, load the AppComponent as top-level component.
__template variable__ a local variable on the template - used to bind input value to this input variable along with binding to this input element on the template; a '#' hash is used to symbolize the template variable and is called a __resolve__.
__host__ the element (in template .html) this component (.ts) is attached to.
__@HostBinding__ using this means we encapsulate the markup tag within our component. We don't have to both use an app-componentName tag AND require a class="row" in the markup of the parent view. By using the @HostBinding decorator, we're able to configure our host element from _within_ the component.
__propagate__ by default, JavaScript transmits events to parents (due to event calls), and browser tries to follow the empty link which tells the browser to reload. Replace the default in function by stating a 'return false'.

COMMANDS
---
$ ng serve --port 9001  // if default port occupied (4200)
$ ng generate component <comp-name>


BOOTSTRAPPING CRASH COURSE
---
This application is built using Angular CLI (which is built on a tool called "Webpack"). Hence, ability to run 'ng serve' command.
**ng - app rendering process:**
1. angular.json - specifies a "main" file, which in this case is "main.ts"
2. main.ts - entry point for our app and bootstraps app
3. Angular module - a main module that ng bootstraps throughout this process; in this case it's 'AppModule' specified at src/app/app.module.ts
4. AppModule - specifies which components to use; in this case, it's AppComponent
5. AppComponent - renders other components

NgMdoule - the Angular module system.

Angular has a powerful concept of 'modules'. When we boot an Angular app, we are not booting a component directly but instead we create a NgModule which points to the component we want to load. Hence, why we see the @NgModule decorator. This adds the metadata to the class immediately in our main module (i.e. AppModule).

__@NgModule__ has 4 keys: 1) declarations, 2) imports, 3) providers, 4) bootstrap.

Compilers
1. TypeScript gives us Decorators. -- github.com/microsoft/TypeScript
2. Traceur gives us Annotations. -- github.com/google/traceur-compiler
https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/Getting-Started

Angular supports both.
